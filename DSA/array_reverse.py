# Given an array arr[], the task is to reverse the array. 
# Reversing an array means rearranging the elements such that the first element becomes the last, 
# the second element becomes second last and so on.

# nput: arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5}  
# Output: {5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1}
# Explanation: The first element 1 moves to last position, the second element 4 moves to second-last and so on.

# Input: arr[] = {4, 5, 1, 2} 
# Output: {2, 1, 5, 4}
# Explanation: The first element 4 moves to last position, the second element 5 moves to second last and so on.
